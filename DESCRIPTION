Authors@R: person("Jieun", "Shin", email = "jieunstat@uos.ac.kr", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package provides functions for estimating sparse nonlinear functions in nonparametric regression. The functions are based on component selection and smoothing and are specifically designed for the analysis of high-dimensional data. The models can be applied to a variety of data types, including models of exponential family and Cox proportional hazards models.
