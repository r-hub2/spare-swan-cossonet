Description: The component selection and smoothing operator (COSSO) is a function that estimates sparse nonlinear components. This model is an extension of the COSSO regression model to make it functional and practical for high-dimensional data. This model supports a variety of response types, including the exponential family and Cox proportional hazards models.
